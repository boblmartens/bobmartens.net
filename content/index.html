<h1>You found me!</h1>

<p>My name is Bob and I'm a 24 year-old developer/husband/father/musician who likes to spend my time reading, learning, coding, spending time with my family and a lot of other stuff. You can find out things about me by checking out the links on the left side of the page.</p>

<p>I work mainly with web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and programming using <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. I'm also trying to branch into <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/">Mac OS</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">iOS</a> programming as well, but that is currently a slow process. If you are looking for some example code, you can find the source code for my personal projects at <a href="http://github.com/boblmartens">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Currently I'm not working on anything in particular (besides client work), but I have in the back of my head the idea for an OSS church management system. If that might interest you, we need to talk.</p> 

<p>I'm available for hire through my single-man consultancy, <a href="http://replosion.net">Replosion, LLC</a>, or you can <a href="mailto:boblmartens@gmail.com">email me</a> if you have any possible work or would like to chat.</p>
